# Next Word Prediction App (Shiny)

This is a Shiny web application that predicts the next word given a phrase using an n-gram language model.

## 📦 Contents

- `app.R`: The Shiny app source code
- `trigrams.rds`: Trigram data used for predictions
- `bigrams.rds`: Bigram data used for backoff prediction
- `notebooks/`: Python script that shows how data was created

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Open RStudio.
2. Place all files in a single folder.
3. Open `app.R` and click **Run App**.

## 🧠 How it Works

- The model uses trigram and bigram frequency tables.
- If a trigram match isn't found, it backs off to bigrams.
- Uses `dplyr`, `stringr`, and base R.
